description: Though he was born in England and spent much of his life in that country,
  author Harold Bindloss is remembered as one of the foremost chroniclers of the pioneer
  era in Canada. The novel Northwest! follows protagonist Jimmy Leyland as he attempts
  to find his fortune -- and perhaps romance -- in the Canadian countryside.
